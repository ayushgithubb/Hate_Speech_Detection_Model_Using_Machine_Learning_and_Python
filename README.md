# Hate_Speech_Detection_Model_Using_Machine_Learning_and_Python
Hate Speech Detection Model Using Machine Learning and Python (Self Project)  (Aug’23)
Objective • To create a robust ML model detecting hate speech, offensive language, and discrimination in text data
Centering
Approach
• Employing the advanced features of the pandas library, the dataset underwent a meticulous structuring process, resulting in a
well-organized format that greatly facilitated the seamless execution of subsequent operations
• Employed regular expressions (re) to meticulously remove special characters, mentions, and URLs, further enhancing the
quality and coherence of the textual dataset
• Recognized a notable class imbalance within the dataset, revealing a pronounced dissimilarity between instances classified as
hate speech and those categorized as non-hate speech
Impact • Achieved an impressive F1 score of 0.9696, thus serving as a testament to the model’s exceptional capability in accurately
categorizing instances of hate speech
